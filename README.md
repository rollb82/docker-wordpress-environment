This project allows a developer to set up a quick wordpress development environment using docker containers.

You need to have docker installed on your machine.

Steps
Install docker
Open your terminal and run the following: docker-compose up -d

Exporting Data
You can export data by running the export.sh script in your terminal.
Use "sh export.sh" if you are on a mac. Note: this can only be done after docker-compose has set up your environment and created the correct folders.
